Description: This package calculates a similarity coefficient using the fold changes of shared features (e.g. genes) among clusters of different samples/batches/datasets. The similarity coefficient is calculated using the dot-product (Hadamard product) of every pairwise combination of Fold Changes between a source cluster i of sample/dataset n and all the target clusters j in sample/dataset m
